## What if I had more time? 

- Create a theme for the app
- Make the app responsive
- Refactor and reorganize the code better

** I have designed the whole app. If the design files are provided beforehand to me, I would have been able to implement the UI faster. Being a frontend developer, I have tried my best to make
the website presentable. I have also added some animations to make the website more interactive.
** With that if all the query-documents are provided for all the graphql calls, It would be faster to create the app

Please note that , I have not coded the ships details and search by rocket-name (search by mission name is added). We can talk more about this.
